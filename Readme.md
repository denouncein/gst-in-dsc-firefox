This docker project is work in progress and not ready for use.

This is being specifically built to make it easier to file GST in India with Digital Signature Certificate and emSigner Java Applet.

This is troublesome integration that has a number of issues.  this image will demonstrate how to bring multiple components together on a unix machine to help with GST.  This is not meant to produce a ready to use image.  

PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE Dockerfile AS DOING SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS FILING A RETURN ON A CONTAINERIZED FIREFOX INSTANCE IS RISKY UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT INTO THE CONTAINER IMAGE!
